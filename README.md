# Status UDP Plugin
You should clone trunk-recorder first.
Then `cd` into `/trunk-recorder/user_plugins/`
Then git clone this repository into that directory.
It should create a subdirectory named `tr-plugin-udp`.
With this repo in the correct directory, it will be built automatically along side `trunk-recorder` thanks to some CMake magic.
